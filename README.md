# groupCreation
Simple recursive algorithms to create groups at random or by strength levels. For strength levels, `yetStrongStudents` are distributed among `strongStudents` randomly and evenly. 

# How to use
1. In `students-roster` directory, add students to `student_full-roster.js` and/or divide them appropriately in `students_by_strength.js`.

2. When ready to create groups, run either of the following commands in node: 
```
node shuffle_full-roster
node shuffle_by_strength
```

3. NOTE: If creating groups based on full roster then be sure to set desired group size on `line 4`.
