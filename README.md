# createGroups
Simple recursive algorithm to create groups fairly. Distributes `yetStrongStudents` among `strongStudents` randomly and evenly. 

## How to use
1. Identify strongest students in your class and put their names in the `strongStudents` object.
2. Similarly, put the remaining students in the `yetStrongStudents` array. 
3. Run program. 

## Future Development
Include a check to ensure that groups stay within 3 - 5 people and notify user of program if not, i.e. 'Please provide at least 2 more strong students to keep groups under 5 people.'

# group
